#Simple CMS management using PHP

1. Data based in PHP variables
2. Body text stored in markdown files (.txt)

## Running Notes

It will probably be easiest to simply link to this directory in the xampp/www/ 
folder so you can easily test how the CMS will work since you need PHP for 
anything to work.
